    "text": "Gridscape turns research and ideation from a conversation into a map. Instead of asking questions and getting answers in a single thread, you draw rectangles on an infinite canvas. Each rectangle becomes a node of synthesized knowledge, and each connection between nodes includes an explicit bridge of reasoning. You end up with a spatial document that shows not just what you've explored but how the ideas relate to each other.\n\nThe interface uses ASCII schematics to visualize conceptual relationships, giving it a lo-fi, almost archival quality. This isn't just an aesthetic choice. It frames the output as working drafts rather than polished answers. Every node can have multiple versions. Every link explains why it exists.\n\nThe result is a different way of thinking with AI. You're not prompting a chatbot, you're navigating a landscape. Draw a frame to synthesize something new. Follow a suggested path or make your own. The canvas grows with you and lets you get productively lost in the process.",

    "text": "Flickbook transforms your viewing history into a personal entertainment passport. Every movie and show you watch earns a unique, AI-generated stamp that gets added to your collection grid. Think of it as a visual diary of your screen time, where each stamp captures not just what you watched, but when you watched it.\n\nThe stamps are designed to evoke the nostalgia of travel passport stamps, with vintage typography, circular borders, and distinct visual motifs pulled from each title. Google Gemini generates these stamps in real time, creating artwork that feels both personal and collectible. Over time, your Flickbook becomes a beautiful archive of your cinematic journey.\n\nFlickbook turns passive consumption into something tangible. Instead of a forgettable list buried in an app, you get a curated gallery of memories. Share your passport with friends, compare collections, or simply scroll through the stamps and remember why you loved each watch.",

    "text": "Elemental began as a simple question: what if the periodic table could answer back? Instead of memorizing elements in isolation, I wanted to build something that lets you explore chemistry the way scientists actually think about it. Start with a material you encounter every day, ask what it's made of, and watch the fundamental building blocks reveal themselves. The reverse search flips the traditional approach on its head, turning passive learning into active discovery.\n\nThe physics simulations emerged from a desire to make abstract concepts feel tangible. When irrelevant elements fall away during a search, it's not just a visual trick. It's a reminder that chemistry is about relationships and reactions, not static facts on a chart. The element relationships feature takes this further, letting you pair any two elements and explore how they bond, what compounds they form, and where those materials show up in the real world. Zirconium and boron might seem obscure until you learn they combine to create materials that survive 2000 degrees Celsius in jet engines.\n\nThis project is an ongoing experiment in making science more intuitive. Every feature is designed around a simple principle: understanding emerges from interaction, not instruction. Whether you're a student trying to grasp why sodium reacts violently with water or just curious about what's inside your phone screen, Elemental aims to turn that curiosity into genuine comprehension. The periodic table is a map of everything that exists. This app is an attempt to make that map worth exploring.",
